\title{Confidence Interval for Extinction Time using maximum likelihood (asymptotic)}
\usage{
mle_cutt(
  ages,
  sd,
  K,
  df = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05,
  q = c(lo = alpha/2, point = 0.5, hi = 1 - alpha/2),
  wald = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ages}{Numeric vector of fossil ages, with smaller values being more recent fossil ages.}

\item{sd}{Numeric vector of measurement error standard deviations for each fossil (listed in the same order as they appear in \code{ages}).}

\item{K}{Numeric upper bound for fossil ages - how old fossils can be before they are ignored, for the purpose of this analysis. A sensible choice of \code{K} is
close to the age of the oldest fossil.}

\item{df}{Numeric; degrees of freedom for the t-distribution used to model measurement error. Must be greater than 2. Uses a Gaussian distribution if \code{df=Inf}.
Default (\code{NULL}) estimates \code{df} from the data.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric between 0 and 1. Used to find a 100(1-\code{alpha})\% confidence interval. Defaults to 0.05 (95\% confidence intervals).
If \code{alpha=NULL}, returns a maximum likelihood estimator only.}

\item{q}{Numeric vector of values between 0 and 1, specifying the quantiles at which we want to solve for extinction time. Defaults to \code{c(alpha/2,1-alpha/2)},
which gives the limits of a 100(1-\code{alpha})\% confidence interval. If \code{q} is specified it overrides any input for \code{alpha}.}

\item{wald}{logical; FALSE (default) uses profile likelihood, comparing the likelihood ratio statistic to a quantile from the chi-squared distribution,
TRUE uses a Wald interval (which has very poor performance for small sample sizes!)}

\item{...}{logical; FALSE (default) uses profile likelihood, comparing the likelihood ratio statistic to a quantile from the chi-squared distribution,
TRUE uses a Wald interval (which has very poor performance for small sample sizes!)}
}
\value{
This function returns an object of class "est_cutt" with the following components:

 \item{theta}{ a maximum likelihood estimator of \code{theta}.}
 \item{se}{ the estimated standard error of the MLE.}
 \item{ci}{ a vector of confidence limits for \code{theta} at the chosen confidence levels.}
 \item{q}{ the vector of quantiles used in estimation (if applicable).}
 \item{df}{ the estimated degrees of freedom of the Student's T distribution for measurement error.}
 \item{data}{ a data frame with the data used in analysis, in columns labelled as \code{ages} and \code{sd}}
 \item{call }{ the function call}
}
\description{
Estimates a confidence interval for extinction time using maximum likelihood techniques -- either a Wald interval is used or
a profile likelihood technique is used, inverting the likelihood ratio statistic comparing to the appropriate quantile for the chi-squared distribution.
These methods do not have good small sample properties, especially when the measurement error is small, \code{\link{reginv_cutt}} is preferred in these settings.
}
\details{
Given a vector of fossil ages \code{ages} and corresponding measurement error standard deviations \code{sd}, and an upper limit \code{K} for the possible age of a fossil
that could be included in this dataset, our procedure then assumes that:
\itemize{
\item That, for a fossil of a given age, measurement error estimating its age follows a distribution that is Student's T multiplied by the provided standard deviation, truncated such that observed age is less than \code{K}
\item That fossil dates are uniformly distributed over the interval of allowable dates
}
We then estimate extinction time using the maximum likelihood estimator, and construct a confidence interval either using profile likelihood
or a Wald interval. The profile likelihood approach finds the set of all extinction times \code{theta} such that a likelihood ratio test that the true
extinction time were \code{theta} would not be significant at level \code{alpha}, when comparing the likelihood ratio to a chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom.
The Wald interval assumes the maximum likelihood estimator is normally distributed and constructs a symmetric interval using the observed information matrix.
The Wald interval performs poorly unless measurement error and sample size are both large and is not recommended (except perhaps to obtain starting estimates for other algorithms).

It is assumed that \code{ages} has been specified with smaller values representing more recent specimens, for example, \code{ages} could be specified in years before present.
If there is interest in estimating speciation or invasion time, data would only need to be reordered so that smaller values represent older specimens.
